Name: pyCraps
Version: Unreleased
Release Date: Unreleased

Goal:
The idea here is to create a Craps game to help me get more familiar
with both the game of Craps itself and the Python language.

Priorities:
	1.) Get a game engine going with a minimal set of table spaces
	2.) Get a more complete set of table spaces
	3.) Get a very basic CLI going
	4.) Make it a multi-player game
	5.) Basic GUI?
	6.) Network game?
	7.) Prettier GUI?

Then, once I understand more fully how the game works, I can retire and 
live only on my Craps winnings...

That'll be the day!
